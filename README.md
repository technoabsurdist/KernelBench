## 👋 Task Description

We structure the problem for LLM to transpile operators described in PyTorch to CUDA kernels, at whatever level of granularity it desires to.

We construct Kernel Bench to have 4 Levels of categories:

- **Level 1 🧱**: Single-kernel operators (100 Problems)
  The foundational building blocks of neural nets (Convolutions, Matrix multiplies, Layer normalization)
- **Level 2 🔗**: Simple fusion patterns (100 Problems)
  A fused kernel would be faster than separated kernels (Conv + Bias + ReLU, Matmul + Scale + Sigmoid)
- **Level 3 ⚛️**: Full model architectures (50 Problems)
  Optimize entire model architectures end-to-end (MobileNet, VGG, MiniGPT, Mamba)
- **Level 4 🤗**: Level Hugging Face
  Optimize whole model architectures from HuggingFace

## ⚖️ Evaluation

#### Methodology

To evaluate model-generated kernels, we need to check if they:

- **is correct ✅**: check against reference torch operators `n_correctness` times on randomized inputs.
- **is performant ⏱️**: compare against reference torch operators `n_trial` times to measure speedup between runtimes.

Check out `src/eval.py` for details on how we implement correctness check and timing.

We provide a convenient script `scripts/run_and_check.py` to evaluate one single sample source code against a reference source code, check correctness and compute speedup. You can use this to evaluate a model-generated kernel.

#### Overall Benchmark Metric

Since we need to capture **both** correctness and performance, we define a metric `fast_p`: fraction of tasks that are both correct and have a speedup greater than threshold `p`; speedup is computed as the ratio of PyTorch reference wall-clock time to generated kernel time.

Some examples to illustrate this metric that filters based on speedups:

- `fast_1` is the fraction of tasks that LM-generated kernels are both correct and **faster** than PyTorch baseline
- `fast_2` is the fraction of tasks that LM-generated kernels are both correct and **at least 2x faster** than PyTorch baseline
- `fast_0` is the fraction of tasks that LM-generated kernels are **correct**. (same as correctness rate)

You can increase speedup threshold `p` to make the task more challenging.

#### Compute Overall Benchmark Performance

We provide a script `scripts/greedy_analysis.py` to compute the overall benchmark performance.

## 🔧 Set up

```bash
# create conda env
conda create -n kernel-rft python=3.10
conda activate kernel-rft

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# set api keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Run on a single problem

It is easier to get started with a single problem. This will fetch the problem, generate a sample, and evaluate the sample.

```bash
# local eval (requires gpu)
python scripts/generate_and_eval_single_sample.py \
    dataset_src=huggingface \
    level=1 \
    problem_id=40 \
    server_type=openai \
    model_name=gpt-4 \
    verbose_logging=True

# modal eval (cloud gpu)
python scripts/generate_and_eval_single_sample_modal.py \
    dataset_src=huggingface \
    level=1 \
    problem_id=40 \
    server_type=openai \
    model_name=o4-mini-2025-04-16 \
    verbose_logging=True
```

### Run on all problems

```bash
# generate samples
python scripts/generate_samples.py \
    dataset_src=huggingface \
    level=1 \
    run_name=test_run \
    server_type=openai \
    model_name=gpt-4

# evaluate samples
python scripts/eval_from_generations.py \
    dataset_src=huggingface \
    level=1 \
    run_name=test_run
```

### Analyze the eval results to compute Benchmark Performance

We provide `scripts/benchmark_eval_analysis.py` to analyze the eval results to compute success rate, timing metric, and overall benchmark performance `fast_p`.

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmark_eval_analysis.py run_name=test_run level=1 hardware=L40S_matx3 baseline=baseline_time_torch
```

If you are using a different hardware, you can generate the baseline time with `scripts/generate_baseline_time.py` script.
We provide some reference baseline times a variety of NVIDIA GPUs across generations in `results/timing`, but we recommend you to generate your own baseline time for more accurate results (cluster power, software version, all affects timing result). See `results/timing/README.md` for more details.
